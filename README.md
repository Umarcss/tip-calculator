### What I Learned

During the development of this tip calculator, I focused on:

- **Responsive Design**: Implementing a mobile-first workflow and adapting the layout for various screen sizes using media queries, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.
- **JavaScript Logic**: Building the core calculation logic, including input validation, error handling, and dynamic updates of tip and total amounts.
- **Event Handling**: Efficiently managing user interactions with input fields and tip selection buttons.
- **SASS for Styling**: Utilizing SASS to organize and maintain CSS, making it more modular and readable with variables and nested rules.

### Continued Development

I plan to continue improving this project by:

- Enhancing accessibility features.
- Adding more robust error handling and user feedback.
- Exploring different animation and transition effects for a smoother user experience.
